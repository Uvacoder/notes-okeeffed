Use pink noise instead of one of your first sounds.`}</p>\n    <p>{`There are different colour noises. Talking about different coloured noise generally means talking about different coloured noise spectrums.`}</p>\n    <p>{`White noise has the same power across different frequencies.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Pink noise has a steadily decresing slope of energy across the spectrum. Pink noise is used to being linear in logarithmic space and follows a similar spectrum to finished tracks.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Since each octave in pink noise contains the same energy, we can use this calibrated at -20dB for scale and bring in new the noises and mix until we can hear it just above the pink noise.`}</p>\n    <p>{`As for the pink noise, you can grab a sample from the resources on this course to use on another track.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
