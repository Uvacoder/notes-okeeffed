An atomic system must guarantee atomicity in each and every situation, including power failures, errors and crashes. A guarantee of atomicity prevents updates to the database occurring only partially, which can cause greater problems than rejecting the whole series outright.

Eventual consistency is a weak guarantee – most stronger models, like linearizability are trivially eventually consistent, but a system that is merely eventually consistent does not usually fulfill these stronger constraints.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Eventually-consistent services are often classified as providing BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency) semantics, in contrast to traditional ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) guarantees. In chemistry BASE is opposite to ACID, which helps remembering the acronym. According to the same resource, these are the rough definitions of each term in BASE:`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`(B)asically (A)vailable: basic reading and writing operations are available as much as possible (using all nodes of a database cluster), but without any kind of consistency guarantees (the write may not persist after conflicts are reconciled, the read may not get the latest write).`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`(S)oft state: without consistency guarantees, after some amount of time, we only have some probability of knowing the state, since it may not yet have converged.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`(E)ventually consistent: If the system is functioning and we wait long enough after any given set of inputs, we will eventually be able to know what the state of the database is, and so any further reads will be consistent with our expectations.`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>{`Eventual consistency is sometimes criticized as increasing the complexity of distributed software applications. This is partly because eventual consistency is purely a liveness guarantee (reads eventually return the same value) and does not make safety guarantees: `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`an eventually consistent system can return any value before it converges.`}</strong></p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"column-oriented-dbms\"\n    }}>{`Column-oriented DBMS`}</h2>\n    <p>{`A column-oriented DBMS (or columnar database management system) is a database management system (DBMS) that stores data tables by column rather than by row. Practical use of a column store versus a row store differs little in the relational DBMS world. Both columnar and row databases can use traditional database query languages like SQL to load data and perform queries.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Both row and columnar databases can become the backbone in a system to serve data for common extract, transform, load (ETL) and data visualization tools. However, by storing data in columns rather than rows, the database can more precisely access the data it needs to answer a query rather than scanning and discarding unwanted data in rows. Query performance is increased for certain workloads.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
