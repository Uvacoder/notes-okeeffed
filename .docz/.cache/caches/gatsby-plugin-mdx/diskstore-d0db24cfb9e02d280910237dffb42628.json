A clustered index is an index where the leaf level of the index contains the actual data rows of the table. A clustered is much like any other index: it is defined on one or more columns. These form the index key. The clustering key is then the key columns of a clustered index. A clustered index scan is then basically the operation of your RDBMS reading through for the row or rows from top to bottom in the clustered index.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Consider the following query example, where the there’s an index on i_id and which would generally result in a complexity of `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`O(log(n))`}</inlineCode>{`:`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-sql\"\n      }}>{`SELECT i_stock\nFROM item\nWHERE i_id = N;\n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`Note that without the index, the time complexity would have been O(n).`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"quadratic-time-on2\"\n    }}>{`Quadratic Time: O(n^2)`}</h3>\n    <p>{`An algorithm is said to run in quadratic time if its time execution is proportional to the square of the input size.
