Guess— Based on what you’ve learned so far, which of your ideas do you think will make the biggest impact? Which?— Decide which change to make. Act— Actually make the change. Measure— What happened? Was the change positive or negative? Should you keep the change, or go back to how things were before this iteration?`}</p>\n    <p>{`Kaufman, Josh.
