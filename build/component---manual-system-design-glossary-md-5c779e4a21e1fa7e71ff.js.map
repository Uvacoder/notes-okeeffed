Any distributed system that can continuously evolve in order to support the growing amount of work is considered to be scalable.`}</p>\n    <p>{`A system may have to scale because of many reasons like increased data volume or increased amount of work, e.g., number of transactions. A scalable system would like to achieve this scaling without performance loss.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Good examples of horizontal scaling are Cassandra and MongoDB as they both provide an easy way to scale horizontally by adding more machines to meet growing needs. Similarly, a good example of vertical scaling is MySQL as it allows for an easy way to scale vertically by switching from smaller to bigger machines. However, this process often involves downtime.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"reliability\"\n    }}>{`Reliability`}</h2>\n    <p>{`By definition, reliability is the probability a system will fail in a given period. In simple terms, a distributed system is considered reliable if it keeps delivering its services even when one or several of its software or hardware components fail.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Take the example of a large electronic commerce store (like Amazon), where one of the primary requirement is that any user transaction should never be canceled due to a failure of the machine that is running that transaction. For instance, if a user has added an item to their shopping cart, the system is expected not to lose it. A reliable distributed system achieves this through redundancy of both the software components and data. If the server carrying the user’s shopping cart fails, another server that has the exact replica of the shopping cart should replace it.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Obviously, redundancy has a cost and a reliable system has to pay that to achieve such resilience for services by eliminating every single point of failure.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"efficiency\"\n    }}>{`Efficiency`}</h2>\n    <p>{`To understand how to measure the efficiency of a distributed system, let’s assume we have an operation that runs in a distributed manner and delivers a set of items as result. Two standard measures of its efficiency are the response time (or latency) that denotes the delay to obtain the first item and the throughput (or bandwidth) which denotes the number of items delivered in a given time unit (e.g., a second).

Generally speaking, the analysis of a distributed structure in terms of 'number of messages' is over-simplistic. It ignores the impact of many aspects, including the network topology, the network load, and its variation, the possible heterogeneity of the software and hardware components involved in data processing and routing, etc. However, it is quite difficult to develop a precise cost model that would accurately take into account all these performance factors; therefore, we have to live with rough but robust estimates of the system behavior.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"availability\"\n    }}>{`Availability`}</h2>\n    <p>{`By definition, availability is the time a system remains operational to perform its required function in a specific period.

However, if it is available, it is not necessarily reliable. In other words, high reliability contributes to high availability, but it is possible to achieve a high availability even with an unreliable product by minimizing repair time and ensuring that spares are always available when they are needed.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"manageability\"\n    }}>{`Manageability`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Ease of operation and maintenance.

If a server is not available to take new requests or is not responding or has elevated error rate, LB will stop sending traffic to such a server.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Load balancer typically sits between the client and the server accepting incoming network and application traffic and distributing the traffic across multiple backend servers using various algorithms.`}</p>\n    <p>{`By balancing app requests, the LB reduces individual server load and prevents one single application from becoming a single point of failure - improving overall application availability and responsiveness.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"utilizing-full-scalability-and-redundancy\"\n    }}>{`Utilizing full scalability and redundancy`}</h3>\n    <p>{`To utilize full scalability and redundancy, we can try to balance the load at each layer of the system.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This could mean before a web server layer, an application server layer and database server layer.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"lb-pros\"\n    }}>{`LB Pros`}</h3>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`UX is faster, uninterrupted.

If the request layer is expanded to multiple nodes, it’s still quite possible to have each node host its own cache.
