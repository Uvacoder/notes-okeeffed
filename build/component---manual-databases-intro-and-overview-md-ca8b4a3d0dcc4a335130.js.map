It is a web service running \"in the cloud\" designed to simplify the setup, operation, and scaling of a relational database for use in applications. Administration processes like patching the database software, backing up databases and enabling point-in-time recovery are managed automatically. Scaling storage and compute resources can be performed by a single API call as AWS does not offer an ssh connection to RDS instances.`}</p>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"newsql-databases\"\n    }}>{`NewSQL databases`}</h2>\n    <p>{`NewSQL is a class of relational database management systems that seek to provide the scalability of NoSQL systems for online transaction processing (OLTP) workloads while maintaining the ACID guarantees of a traditional database system.`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"https://www.memsql.com/\"\n        }}>{`MemSQL`}</a>{`: A modern relational database for cloud and on-premises that delivers immediate insights for modern applications and analytical systems.

The unit of transaction is the stored procedure, written in Java interspersed with SQL. VoltDB relies on horizontal partitioning down to the individual hardware thread to scale, k-safety (synchronous replication) to provide high availability, and a combination of continuous snapshots and command logging for durability (crash recovery).`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"cap-theorem\"\n    }}>{`CAP Theorem`}</h2>\n    <p>{`(From Wikipedia)`}</p>\n    <p>{`In theoretical computer science, the CAP theorem, also named Brewer's theorem after computer scientist Eric Brewer, states that it is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide more than two out of the following three guarantees:`}</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`Consistency: Every read receives the most recent write or an error`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`Availability: Every request receives a (non-error) response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`Partition tolerance: The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes`}</li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>{`When a network partition failure happens should we decide to:`}</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`Cancel the operation and thus decrease the availability but ensure consistency`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`Proceed with the operation and thus provide availability but risk inconsistency`}</li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>{`The CAP theorem implies that in the presence of a network partition, one has to choose between consistency and availability.

For example, a transfer of funds from one bank account to another, even involving multiple changes such as debiting one account and crediting another, is a single transaction.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"atomicity\"\n    }}>{`Atomicity`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Transactions are often composed of multiple statements. Atomicity guarantees that each transaction is treated as a single \"unit\", which either succeeds completely, or fails completely: if any of the statements constituting a transaction fails to complete, the entire transaction fails and the database is left unchanged. An atomic system must guarantee atomicity in each and every situation, including power failures, errors and crashes. A guarantee of atomicity prevents updates to the database occurring only partially, which can cause greater problems than rejecting the whole series outright. As a consequence, the transaction cannot be observed to be in progress by another database client. At one moment in time, it has not yet happened, and at the next it has already occurred in whole (or nothing happened if the transaction was cancelled in progress).`}</p>\n    <p>{`An example of an atomic transaction is a monetary transfer from bank account A to account B. It consists of two operations, withdrawing the money from account A and saving it to account B. Performing these operations in an atomic transaction ensures that the database remains in a consistent state, that is, money is neither lost nor created if either of those two operations fail.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"consistency\"\n    }}>{`Consistency`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Consistency ensures that a transaction can only bring the database from one valid state to another, maintaining database invariants: any data written to the database must be valid according to all defined rules, including constraints, cascades, triggers, and any combination thereof. This prevents database corruption by an illegal transaction, but does not guarantee that a transaction is correct. Referential integrity guarantees the primary key – foreign key relationship.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"isolation\"\n    }}>{`Isolation`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Transactions are often executed concurrently (e.g., multiple transactions reading and writing to a table at the same time). Isolation ensures that concurrent execution of transactions leaves the database in the same state that would have been obtained if the transactions were executed sequentially. Isolation is the main goal of concurrency control; depending on the method used, the effects of an incomplete transaction might not even be visible to other transactions.`}</p>\n    <h3 {...{\n      \"id\": \"durability\"\n    }}>{`Durability`}</h3>\n    <p>{`Durability guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain committed even in the case of a system failure (e.g., power outage or crash). This usually means that completed transactions (or their effects) are recorded in non-volatile memory.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"base-eventual-consistency\"\n    }}>{`BASE: Eventual Consistency`}</h2>\n    <p>{`(From Wikipedia)`}</p>\n    <p>{`Eventual consistency is a consistency model used in distributed computing to achieve high availability that informally guarantees that, if no new updates are made to a given data item, eventually all accesses to that item will return the last updated value. Eventual consistency, also called optimistic replication, is widely deployed in distributed systems, and has origins in early mobile computing projects. A system that has achieved eventual consistency is often said to have converged, or achieved replica convergence. Eventual consistency is a weak guarantee – most stronger models, like linearizability are trivially eventually consistent, but a system that is merely eventually consistent does not usually fulfill these stronger constraints.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Eventually-consistent services are often classified as providing BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency) semantics, in contrast to traditional ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) guarantees.
