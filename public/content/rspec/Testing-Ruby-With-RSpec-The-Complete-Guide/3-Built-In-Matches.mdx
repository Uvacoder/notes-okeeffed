# 3: Built-In Matchers

A matcher is a type of assertion or expectation.

## The `not_to` method

```rb
RSpec.describe 'not_to method' do
	it 'checks that two values do not match' do
		expect(5).not_to eq(4)
	end
end
```

## Equality matches

The matcher to use depends on how strict you want the cmparison.

| Matcher | Does                                  |
| ------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `eq`    | Tests for value and ignores type.     |
| `eql`   | Tests for value AND strict type.      |
| `equal` | Checks exact identity ie. same memory |
| `be`    | Alias for `equal`                     |

## Comparison matchers

| Matcher  | Does                |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| `be > 5` | Comparison operator |

The usual comparison operators can be used within here.

## Predicate matchers

A predicate method is a method with a `?` at the end which should return a boolean.

Some examples:

```rb
puts 0.zero?
puts 2.even?
puts 11.odd?
puts [].empty?
```

In our tests, we could do the following for predicate methods:

```rb
it 'can be tested with predicate matchers' do
	expect(16 / 2).to be_even
end
```

Basically we can use the `be_<predicate_method>` syntax.

## `all` matcher

Say we want `[5,7,9]` to check if all values are odd.

```rb
it 'allows for aggregate checks' do
	expect([5,7,9]).to all(be_odd)
end
```

## `be` matcher

`false` and `nil` are the only falsy values.

This section had the `be_falsy` and `be_truthy` methods.

There is also a `be_nil` check.
