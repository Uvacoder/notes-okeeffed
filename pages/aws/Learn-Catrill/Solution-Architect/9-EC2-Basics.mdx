# 9: EC2 Basics

## Virtualization 101

EC2 is "Virtualization as a service".

Virtualization enables the ability to run multiple operating systems on the same physical machine.

### Emulated Virtualization

Virtualization OSs run on top of host OS/hypervisor. The combination of the OS and apps are known as Virtual Machines.

The hypervisor runs binary translation to ensure virtual machines didn't clash, but this came with a performance penalty.

### Para-virtualization

This only works on a small subset of OSs.
