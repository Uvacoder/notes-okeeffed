# Lesson 3: Advanced Solidity

## Immutability of contracts

After you deploy a contract to Ethereum, it’s immutable, which means that it can never be modified or updated again.

The initial code you deploy to a contract is there to stay, permanently, on the blockchain. This is one reason security is such a huge concern in Solidity. If there's a flaw in your contract code, there's no way for you to patch it later. You would have to tell your users to start using a different smart contract address that has the fix.

But this is also a feature of smart contracts. The code is law. If you read the code of a smart contract and verify it, you can be sure that every time you call a function it's going to do exactly what the code says it will do. No one can later change that function and give you unexpected results.

## External dependencies

What happens if another contract has a bug?

For this reason, it often makes sense to have functions that will allow you to update key portions of the DApp.

For example, instead of hard coding the CryptoKitties contract address into our DApp, we should probably have a `setKittyContractAddress` function that lets us change this address in the future in case something happens to the CryptoKitties contract.

```sol
pragma solidity >=0.5.0 <0.6.0;

import "./zombiefactory.sol";

contract KittyInterface {
  function getKitty(uint256 _id) external view returns (
    bool isGestating,
    bool isReady,
    uint256 cooldownIndex,
    uint256 nextActionAt,
    uint256 siringWithId,
    uint256 birthTime,
    uint256 matronId,
    uint256 sireId,
    uint256 generation,
    uint256 genes
  );
}

contract ZombieFeeding is ZombieFactory {

  KittyInterface kittyContract;

  function setKittyContractAddress(address _address) external {
    kittyContract = KittyInterface(_address);
  }

  function feedAndMultiply(uint _zombieId, uint _targetDna, string memory _species) public {
    require(msg.sender == zombieToOwner[_zombieId]);
    Zombie storage myZombie = zombies[_zombieId];
    _targetDna = _targetDna % dnaModulus;
    uint newDna = (myZombie.dna + _targetDna) / 2;
    if (keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_species)) == keccak256(abi.encodePacked("kitty"))) {
      newDna = newDna - newDna % 100 + 99;
    }
    _createZombie("NoName", newDna);
  }

  function feedOnKitty(uint _zombieId, uint _kittyId) public {
    uint kittyDna;
    (,,,,,,,,,kittyDna) = kittyContract.getKitty(_kittyId);
    feedAndMultiply(_zombieId, kittyDna, "kitty");
  }

}
```

## Ownable contracts

`setKittyContractAddress` is `external`, so anyone can call it! That means anyone who called the function could change the address of the CryptoKitties contract, and break our app for all its users.

We do want the ability to update this address in our contract, but we don't want everyone to be able to update it.

To handle cases like this, one common practice that has emerged is to make contracts `Ownable` — meaning they have an owner (you) who has special privileges.

Below is the `Ownable` contract from the `OpenZeplin` lib which is a secure and community-vetted contract:

```sol
/**
 * @title Ownable
 * @dev The Ownable contract has an owner address, and provides basic authorization control
 * functions, this simplifies the implementation of "user permissions".
 */
contract Ownable {
  address private _owner;

  event OwnershipTransferred(
    address indexed previousOwner,
    address indexed newOwner
  );

  /**
   * @dev The Ownable constructor sets the original `owner` of the contract to the sender
   * account.
   */
  constructor() internal {
    _owner = msg.sender;
    emit OwnershipTransferred(address(0), _owner);
  }

  /**
   * @return the address of the owner.
   */
  function owner() public view returns(address) {
    return _owner;
  }

  /**
   * @dev Throws if called by any account other than the owner.
   */
  modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(isOwner());
    _;
  }

  /**
   * @return true if `msg.sender` is the owner of the contract.
   */
  function isOwner() public view returns(bool) {
    return msg.sender == _owner;
  }

  /**
   * @dev Allows the current owner to relinquish control of the contract.
   * @notice Renouncing to ownership will leave the contract without an owner.
   * It will not be possible to call the functions with the `onlyOwner`
   * modifier anymore.
   */
  function renounceOwnership() public onlyOwner {
    emit OwnershipTransferred(_owner, address(0));
    _owner = address(0);
  }

  /**
   * @dev Allows the current owner to transfer control of the contract to a newOwner.
   * @param newOwner The address to transfer ownership to.
   */
  function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public onlyOwner {
    _transferOwnership(newOwner);
  }

  /**
   * @dev Transfers control of the contract to a newOwner.
   * @param newOwner The address to transfer ownership to.
   */
  function _transferOwnership(address newOwner) internal {
    require(newOwner != address(0));
    emit OwnershipTransferred(_owner, newOwner);
    _owner = newOwner;
  }
}
```

Some notes on things we have not seen:

1. Constructors: `constructor()` is a constructor, which is an optional special function that has the same name as the contract. It will get executed only one time, when the contract is first created.
2. Function Modifiers: modifier `onlyOwner()`. Modifiers are kind of half-functions that are used to modify other functions, usually to check some requirements prior to execution. In this case, onlyOwner can be used to limit access so only the owner of the contract can run this function. We'll talk more about function modifiers in the next chapter, and what that weird \_; does.
3. `indexed` keyword: don't worry about this one, we don't need it yet.

So the `Ownable` contract basically does the following:

1. When a contract is created, its constructor sets the owner to `msg.sender` (the person who deployed it).
2. It adds an `onlyOwner` modifier, which can restrict access to certain functions to only the owner.
3. It allows you to transfer the contract to a new owner.

`onlyOwner` is such a common requirement for contracts that most Solidity DApps start with a copy/paste of this Ownable contract, and then their first contract inherits from it.

The example code allows us to inherit from `Ownable`:

```sol
pragma solidity >=0.5.0 <0.6.0;

import "./ownable.sol";

contract ZombieFactory is Ownable {

    event NewZombie(uint zombieId, string name, uint dna);

    uint dnaDigits = 16;
    uint dnaModulus = 10 ** dnaDigits;

    struct Zombie {
        string name;
        uint dna;
    }

    Zombie[] public zombies;

    mapping (uint => address) public zombieToOwner;
    mapping (address => uint) ownerZombieCount;

    function _createZombie(string memory _name, uint _dna) internal {
        uint id = zombies.push(Zombie(_name, _dna)) - 1;
        zombieToOwner[id] = msg.sender;
        ownerZombieCount[msg.sender]++;
        emit NewZombie(id, _name, _dna);
    }

    function _generateRandomDna(string memory _str) private view returns (uint) {
        uint rand = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_str)));
        return rand % dnaModulus;
    }

    function createRandomZombie(string memory _name) public {
        require(ownerZombieCount[msg.sender] == 0);
        uint randDna = _generateRandomDna(_name);
        randDna = randDna - randDna % 100;
        _createZombie(_name, randDna);
    }

}
```

The code that we modify to ensure `onlyOwner` modifier code is used:

```sol
pragma solidity >=0.5.0 <0.6.0;

import "./zombiefactory.sol";

contract KittyInterface {
  function getKitty(uint256 _id) external view returns (
    bool isGestating,
    bool isReady,
    uint256 cooldownIndex,
    uint256 nextActionAt,
    uint256 siringWithId,
    uint256 birthTime,
    uint256 matronId,
    uint256 sireId,
    uint256 generation,
    uint256 genes
  );
}

contract ZombieFeeding is ZombieFactory {

  KittyInterface kittyContract;

  function setKittyContractAddress(address _address) external onlyOwner {
    kittyContract = KittyInterface(_address);
  }

  function feedAndMultiply(uint _zombieId, uint _targetDna, string memory _species) public {
    require(msg.sender == zombieToOwner[_zombieId]);
    Zombie storage myZombie = zombies[_zombieId];
    _targetDna = _targetDna % dnaModulus;
    uint newDna = (myZombie.dna + _targetDna) / 2;
    if (keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_species)) == keccak256(abi.encodePacked("kitty"))) {
      newDna = newDna - newDna % 100 + 99;
    }
    _createZombie("NoName", newDna);
  }

  function feedOnKitty(uint _zombieId, uint _kittyId) public {
    uint kittyDna;
    (,,,,,,,,,kittyDna) = kittyContract.getKitty(_kittyId);
    feedAndMultiply(_zombieId, kittyDna, "kitty");
  }

}
```

## Gas

`Gas` is the **fuel** Ethereum DApps run on.

In Solidity, your users have to pay every time they execute a function on your DApp using a currency called `gas`. Users buy `gas` with Ether (the currency on Ethereum), so your users have to spend ETH in order to execute functions on your DApp.

How much `gas` is required to execute a function depends on how complex that function's logic is. Each individual operation has a `gas` cost based roughly on how much computing resources will be required to perform that operation (e.g. writing to storage is much more expensive than adding two integers). The total `gas` cost of your function is the sum of the `gas` costs of all its individual operations.

Because running functions costs real money for your users, code optimization is much more important in Ethereum than in other programming languages. If your code is sloppy, your users are going to have to pay a premium to execute your functions — and this could add up to millions of dollars in unnecessary fees across thousands of users.

### Why is gas necessary?

Ethereum is like a big, slow, but extremely secure computer. When you execute a function, every single node on the network needs to run that same function to verify its output — thousands of nodes verifying every function execution is what makes Ethereum decentralized, and its data immutable and censorship-resistant.

The creators of Ethereum wanted to make sure someone couldn't clog up the network with an infinite loop, or hog all the network resources with really intensive computations. So they made it so transactions aren't free, and users have to pay for computation time as well as storage.

> Note: This isn't necessarily true for other blockchain, like the ones the CryptoZombies authors are building at Loom Network. It probably won't ever make sense to run a game like World of Warcraft directly on the Ethereum mainnet — the gas costs would be prohibitively expensive. But it could run on a blockchain with a different consensus algorithm. We'll talk more about what types of DApps you would want to deploy on Loom vs the Ethereum mainnet in a future lesson.

## Struct packing to save gas

Normally there's no benefit to using these sub-types because Solidity reserves 256 bits of storage regardless of the `uint` size. For example, using `uint8` instead of `uint` (uint256) won't save you any gas.

But there's an exception to this: inside structs.

If you have multiple uints inside a `struct`, using a smaller-sized uint when possible will allow Solidity to pack these variables together to take up less storage.

Example code:

```sol
pragma solidity >=0.5.0 <0.6.0;

import "./ownable.sol";

contract ZombieFactory is Ownable {

    event NewZombie(uint zombieId, string name, uint dna);

    uint dnaDigits = 16;
    uint dnaModulus = 10 ** dnaDigits;

    struct Zombie {
        string name;
        uint dna;
        uint32 level;
        uint32 readyTime;
    }

    Zombie[] public zombies;

    mapping (uint => address) public zombieToOwner;
    mapping (address => uint) ownerZombieCount;

    function _createZombie(string memory _name, uint _dna) internal {
        uint id = zombies.push(Zombie(_name, _dna)) - 1;
        zombieToOwner[id] = msg.sender;
        ownerZombieCount[msg.sender]++;
        emit NewZombie(id, _name, _dna);
    }

    function _generateRandomDna(string memory _str) private view returns (uint) {
        uint rand = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_str)));
        return rand % dnaModulus;
    }

    function createRandomZombie(string memory _name) public {
        require(ownerZombieCount[msg.sender] == 0);
        uint randDna = _generateRandomDna(_name);
        randDna = randDna - randDna % 100;
        _createZombie(_name, randDna);
    }

}
```
