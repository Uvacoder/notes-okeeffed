# Lesson 4: Zombie Battle system

## Modifiers so far

We have covered bulk modifiers. Modifiers themselves can actually be stacked:

```sol
function test() external view onlyOwner anotherModifier { /* ... */ }
```

## The payable modifier

`payable` functions are part of what makes Solidity and Ethereum so cool — they are a special type of function that can receive Ether.

Let that sink in for a minute. When you call an API function on a normal web server, you can't send US dollars along with your function call — nor can you send Bitcoin.

But in Ethereum, because both the money (Ether), the data (transaction payload), and the contract code itself all live on Ethereum, it's possible for you to call a function and pay money to the contract at the same time.

This allows for some really interesting logic, like requiring a certain payment to the contract in order to execute a function.

An example contract:

```sol
contract OnlineStore {
  function buySomething() external payable {
    // Check to make sure 0.001 ether was sent to the function call:
    require(msg.value == 0.001 ether);
    // If so, some logic to transfer the digital item to the caller of the function:
    transferThing(msg.sender);
  }
}
```

Here, `msg.value` is a way to see how much Ether was sent to the contract, and `ether` is a built-in unit.

From here, someone would make a call from the `web3.js` app:

```js
// Assuming `OnlineStore` points to your contract on Ethereum:
OnlineStore.buySomething({
  from: web3.eth.defaultAccount,
  value: web3.utils.toWei(0.001),
})
```

> Note: If a function is not marked `payable` and you try to send Ether to it as above, the function will reject your transaction.

Here is an example of the implementation to pay to level up a Zombie:

```sol
pragma solidity >=0.5.0 <0.6.0;

import "./zombiefeeding.sol";

contract ZombieHelper is ZombieFeeding {

  uint levelUpFee = 0.001 ether;

  modifier aboveLevel(uint _level, uint _zombieId) {
    require(zombies[_zombieId].level >= _level);
    _;
  }

  function levelUp(uint _zombieId) external payable {
    require(msg.value == levelUpFee);
    zombies[_zombieId].level++;
  }

  function changeName(uint _zombieId, string calldata _newName) external aboveLevel(2, _zombieId) {
    require(msg.sender == zombieToOwner[_zombieId]);
    zombies[_zombieId].name = _newName;
  }

  function changeDna(uint _zombieId, uint _newDna) external aboveLevel(20, _zombieId) {
    require(msg.sender == zombieToOwner[_zombieId]);
    zombies[_zombieId].dna = _newDna;
  }

  function getZombiesByOwner(address _owner) external view returns(uint[] memory) {
    uint[] memory result = new uint[](ownerZombieCount[_owner]);
    uint counter = 0;
    for (uint i = 0; i < zombies.length; i++) {
      if (zombieToOwner[i] == _owner) {
        result[counter] = i;
        counter++;
      }
    }
    return result;
  }

}
```

## Withdraws

After you send Ether to a contract, it gets stored in the contract's Ethereum account, and it will be trapped there — unless you add a function to withdraw the Ether from the contract.

```sol
contract GetPaid is Ownable {
  function withdraw() external onlyOwner {
    address payable _owner = address(uint160(owner()));
    _owner.transfer(address(this).balance);
  }
}
```

It is important to note that you cannot transfer Ether to an address unless that address is of type `address payable`. But the `_owner` variable is of type `uint160`, meaning that we must explicitly cast it to `address payable`.

Once you cast the address from `uint160` to `address payable`, you can transfer Ether to that address using the `transfer` function, and `address(this).balance` will return the total balance stored on the contract. So if 100 users had paid 1 Ether to our contract, `address(this).balance` would equal 100 Ether.

You can use `transfer` to send funds to any Ethereum address. For example, you could have a function that transfers Ether back to the `msg.sender` if they overpaid for an item:

```sol
uint itemFee = 0.001 ether;
msg.sender.transfer(msg.value - itemFee);
```

Or in a contract with a buyer and a seller, you could save the seller's `address` in `storage`, then when someone purchases his item, transfer him the fee paid by the buyer: `seller.transfer(msg.value)`.

These are some examples of what makes Ethereum programming really cool — you can have decentralized marketplaces like this that aren't controlled by anyone.

In our example, we added the capability to withdraw Ether from the contract as well as set the level up fee:

```sol
pragma solidity >=0.5.0 <0.6.0;

import "./zombiefeeding.sol";

contract ZombieHelper is ZombieFeeding {

  uint levelUpFee = 0.001 ether;

  modifier aboveLevel(uint _level, uint _zombieId) {
    require(zombies[_zombieId].level >= _level);
    _;
  }

  function withdraw() external onlyOwner {
    address payable _owner = address(uint160(owner()));
    _owner.transfer(address(this).balance);
  }

  function setLevelUpFee(uint _fee) external onlyOwner {
    levelUpFee = _fee;
  }

  function levelUp(uint _zombieId) external payable {
    require(msg.value == levelUpFee);
    zombies[_zombieId].level++;
  }

  function changeName(uint _zombieId, string calldata _newName) external aboveLevel(2, _zombieId) {
    require(msg.sender == zombieToOwner[_zombieId]);
    zombies[_zombieId].name = _newName;
  }

  function changeDna(uint _zombieId, uint _newDna) external aboveLevel(20, _zombieId) {
    require(msg.sender == zombieToOwner[_zombieId]);
    zombies[_zombieId].dna = _newDna;
  }

  function getZombiesByOwner(address _owner) external view returns(uint[] memory) {
    uint[] memory result = new uint[](ownerZombieCount[_owner]);
    uint counter = 0;
    for (uint i = 0; i < zombies.length; i++) {
      if (zombieToOwner[i] == _owner) {
        result[counter] = i;
        counter++;
      }
    }
    return result;
  }

}
```
