# 5: Solving Real Problems With Ethereum

The first problem that it speaks to is the issues with Kickstarter.

To "fix" this issue in our current project, we have the idea of contributors donating money to an idea person and then that idea person will have the money controlled about which vendor is goes to.

In our contract, the manager needs to create a "spending request" and that request will be approved by all of the contributors.
