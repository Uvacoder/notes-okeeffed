# Lesson Two: Deploying DApps with Truffle

## Truffle init

When you run `truffle init` (if you have installed it globally) it will generate a few folders and files for us:

- `contracts` - where Truffle expects to find contracts.
- `migrations` - a migration is a JS file that tells Truffle how to deploy a smart contract.
- `truffle.js` and `truffle-config.js` - config files used to store the network settings for deployment.

Since we need Truffle to sign transactions, we need a tool called `truffle-hdwallet-provider`.

It can be installed with the following:

```s
$ npm install truffle truffle-hdwallet-provider
# ... install output
```
