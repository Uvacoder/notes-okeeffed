# 6: Architecture Considerations

## Design Quality Attributes

The attributes of the architecture design. Relates to security, performance, scalability etc.

## Conceptual Integrity

- Isolated layers and components
- Application Lifecycle Management
- Healthy team collaboration
- Design and coding standards
- Break away from legacy designs: facade pattern, wrap as the service, rebuild from scratch

## Maintainability

- Isolated layers and components
- Structured communication
- Consider a plugin system
- Rely on platform features
- Use systemwide layer
- Add unit tests
- Documentation

## Reusability

- Component-based architecture
- Adhere to stands
- General-purpose code
- Allow third parties
- Use a plugin system
- Use a systemwide layer

## Testability

- Design for testing
- Allow mocking
- Cover all layers
- Automate case studies

Test:

- Individual components
- Entire layers
- Collaboration between layers
- Load, Security, ...

## Usability

- Elegant & simple UI
- Implementals all case studies in minimal number of interactions
- Clear multi-step workflows
- Intuitive feedback
- Non-technical
